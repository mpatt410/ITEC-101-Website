        <h2>My Four Core Personal Values</h2>

        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>I personally value integrity a lot because of my mother. My mom always taught me to always do the right thing no matter who may be watching. This value has been a staple and has kept a good head on my shoulder throughout the years.</p>
        <p>In order to develop integrity you first must understand what values you stand for. After I did this, it became a lot easier to stay true to my word and be the man I think I should be despite my audience. Also, keeping your word is super important when it comes to having integrity. This is because you cannot lie or make fake promises whilst being a man who does the right thing.</p>

        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>I value respect as one of my core personal values. I believe respect is important because I myself don't like to be disrespected. So, since being disrespected makes me feel bad, why would I want to make others feel that way?</p>
        <p>I developed this value by actually experiencing disrespect. Disrespect is degrading and makes you feel less than, and I actually think that that's a horrible way to feel. So, after experiencing lots of disrespect, I realized that I should hold myself to a higher standard and make sure no person feels the way I did.</p>

        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        <p>Gratitude is a big one for me. I think it is super important that you remain grateful and humble for every opportunity and gift you are given. Being grateful also benefits everyone because you don't hurt anyone's feelings when you appreciate everything.</p>
        <p>I developed gratitude because of my people in my family didn't have much growing up. Seeing family memebers struggle financially really does remind you to be grateful for what you have. You never know when everything could go wrong and you could be left with nothing. So, I learned to appreciate everything I currently have and live freely and enjoy every moment you have because it could be cut short.</p>
        <h3>Balance </h3>
        <p> Having balance is one of my core personal values. I think being able to have balance provides you with the ability to stay level headed at all times. Balance, also teaches you that too much of one thing can be bad, but in moderation it can actually be very beneficial for you both physically and mentally. Overall, having balance provides me to ability to do what is needed by me.</p>
        <p>I developed bance in my life through watching others struggle with addiction. You realize that peoples addictions are caused by to much of something which led me to realize that too much of anything is harmful. In order to conteract this overconsumption I followed the saying everything in moderation.</p>
